# End-to-End MLOps

This project explores Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
as a solution to the challenges of deploying and maintaining ML models in production.
It implements a flexible multi-container system that enables
automated training, deployment, monitoring, and optimization of ML models.
The approach is demonstrated using a distance measurement application with a rearview camera
but is designed to be easily adaptable for various ML applications.
The system ensures scalability, reproducibility, and maintainability,
making it suitable for a wide range of ML use cases.

This project is closely related to my Bachelor's thesis,
which was developed in collaboration with Bosch Engineering GmbH and Hochschule Heilbronn.
The thesis explores the concept of MLOps
and its practical implementation.
You can find the full thesis [here](https://www.mbenediktf.de/end-to-end-mlops/).

I welcome any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or discussions regarding the thesis. This work is intended to serve as a foundation and knowledge base for the practical application of MLOps.

## System architecture

## Quick setup for local test and dev

- Clone repo: `git clone -bare https://github.com/MBenediktF/MLOps.git`
- Navigate to cloned repo: `cd MLOps`
- (Update config in `.env`)
- Start system: `docker-compose up`

A detailed guide for setting up and testing the system
can be found in Appendix B of the thesis, on page 58.
A detailed guide for setting up and testing the system
is provided in Appendix B (Page 58) of the
[thesis](https://www.mbenediktf.de/end-to-end-mlops/)
Additionally, this section covers
how to simulate the edge device and customize the services.
